title: Necessity is the mother of invention 
---

My previous startup, **WhatsOn**, which created personalized, curated social feeds for media companies, required significant computational resources. Being a bootstrapping entrepreneur, and short on cash - my goal was to "make do" with whatever I could get for free, or for the lowest possible cost. My background in software architecture and 'can do' attitude has put me on a path towards an architecture that can do just that.

But as I worked on my solution, I realized that this is a private case of a much broader issue. When companies migrate to the cloud, they expect that their spending on the cloud would be efficient and effective. The reality of the matter is, that moving to the cloud didn't make IT governance and capital efficiency better, the opposite: Over-spending is the norm, rather than the exception, and the degree of over-spending is significant.

When this dime dropped, I wanted to kick myself. I should have realized this sooner. Back in 2004-2007 I was the Chief Architect of **Mercury's** **APM** product line (now HP), called **Business Availability Center** (BAC) AKA **Topaz**. Mercury practically invented the term '**Business Technology Optimization**' (BTO). I have met numerous customers like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin - you name it - and I have seen with my own eyes how BTO delivers value to these customers. A lot has changed since then - but it seems that the problems just got bigger: moving to the cloud created a whole set of new optimization challenges. By 2017, enterprise spending on cloud computing will amount to a projected $235.1B (IHS). How much of that could be saved, and put to better use?

So the following question popped into my mind: the techniques I've used to save a few hundred Dollars per month, could they be generalized and applied to organizations that spend hundreds of thousands, and up to tens of millions of Dollars per month on 'Cloud' (private, public, hybrid, on premises) ?

I decided to take a methodical approach to this question. I started off by meeting with cloud customers (focusing on companies that spend ~$100k per month on Cloud) and interviewing them.

I quickly followed by thrall research, mostly hand-on, in order to learn all the tools and disciplines out there that represent the state-of-the-art.

Then, my next step was to define a functional spec that would address a subset of the market needs, and an architecture that could support it and all the features that are along the path I have chosen.

To make a long story short: The answer is **Yes**. There's a better way to do Cloud, but it requires a different kind of thinking than the line of thought that was used to bring us to create what we all know today as **The Cloud**.

Join me in this journey towards a better cloud - or **cloud technology optimization**.
